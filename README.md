# Advent Of Code - Slack Bot

This repository contains a Slack bot that was inspired by https://github.com/1grzyb1/aoc-slack. It is written in PowerShell and uses the Slack API to post messages to a Slack channel.

It posts a message to Slack each time someone gains a ‚≠ê. It also posts a daily overview of the leaderboard.
